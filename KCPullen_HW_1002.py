# Potential Assignment:  Rock, Paper, Scissor Multi-Player game

# Rules:
#
# Rock wins because it breaks Scissors
# Paper wins because it covers Rock
# Scissors win because it cuts Paper
# A Draw is win players select the same weapon

# Players:
#
# If there is one player, then play against the computer.
# If 2 players, then they play against each other.
# If 3 or more players, then Rules decide winner.

# Gameplay:
#
# The User should first be prompted to enter the number of players and their names.
# If playing solo and against the computer:
#       the user should be prompted to select a weapon.
#       the computer randomly selects a weapon.
#       a 3 - 4 second counter should begin stating "Rock Paper Scissors Go"
#       both weapons should be displayed on the screen and then a message stating the winner.
#           if there is a DRAW, then a message should be displayed and the user should be prompted to select another weapon.
#       the user should be prompted if they would like to play again.
#
# If playing with 2 players:
#       the users should be prompted to select a weapon.
#       the user should be able to make a selection WITHOUT displaying that selection on the screen.
#       after both users have selected weapons, a 3 - 4 second counter should begin.
#       both weapons are displayed on the screen and either a DRAW or winner is declared.
#       if there is a DRAW, then display message and prompt users to select weapons.
#       if there is a WINNER, the display messagea and prompt users to play again.
#
# If playing with 3 or more players:
#       the users should be prompted to select a weapon.
#       the users should be able to make a selection WITHOUT displaying that selection on the screen.
#       after each user has selected a weapon, a 3 - 4 second counter should begin.
#       all weapons are displayed on the screen.
#       based on the rules, the player or players with the lowest weapon(s) loses.
#       the next player or players will continue to play until there is a winner.

# Data Structures suggestions:
#
# Player Class
# GamePlay Class
# Functions for user names and weapons
# Functions to determine winner
# Loops for GamePlay - entire game and multiplayer game
# Try Exception for Weapon selections
